# EnchantSeeker
Minecraft mod for finding the right enchantment from a villager
To use the mod, assign a key in the settings, then use the command /enchantseeker add to select the spell(s) you want to find and their level(s). Place a lectern in the first slot, an axe in the second slot, and press the assigned key. You can stop the mod by pressing the same key again.			


P.S. To ensure the lectern is always collected, you can pour water near the villager to make it roll toward you. Here's an example of the setup (look at the red wool)
